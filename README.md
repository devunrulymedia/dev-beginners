dev-beginners-at-unruly
=================

Curriculum for Unruly's dev school - based on the awesome http://js.opentechschool.org/javascript-for-absolute-beginners.html

To Get Started Helping:
- Get set up with Chrome on Windows (which is what I figure everybody'll have)
- Try the [course](http://devunrulymedia.github.com/dev-beginners/) and see if they make sense!
- Make yourself an admin via our work account, but please commit as you so we know who did what :)
- Tell vikki or fix stuff as you see fit!

Stuff To Change In This Version:
- [x] remove the Deutsch bits, as we can't maintain them and it'll get out of sync

- [ ] remove references to days because ours will be ongoing

- [ ] move sections into separate pages 

- [ ] add feedback  / form

- [ ] put the cheat sheet link on EVERY Page, visible ALL THE TIME!

- [ ] add pop out cheat sheet link

- [ ] add a little table of contents, with stars for when people have done bits - progress :D

- [ ] can't see console in sandbox, would be awesome-sauce to make it visible

- to absolutely go to town, add a help button, which chats to any admins signed in (this is not exactly trivial but web sockets are cool, and we can mess about with this later)
