<h1>Curriculum: part 1, the basics</h1>

<h2 class=step>A web page</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>See how JavaScript programs operate in the context of web
pages.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Open the <a href="/sandbox/#basic.html" target="_blank">example</a>
page.</p>

<p>You will see the source for a very simple HTML page below, with the
actual page shown above it. Read the source.</p>

<p>Try changing something, and clicking the 'Render' button above the
source code. Open the JavaScript console in the new tab.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>What the sandbox page (which is itself a web page written in
JavaScript) allows us to do is to write and try out web pages.<p>

<p>Pieces of JavaScript can be embedded in HTML documents with
the <code>&lt;script></code> tag. In this case, there is a tiny
program embedded that just defines a variable
called <code>myMessage</code> and calls the <code>console.log</code>
function on it.</p>

<p>When entering expressions directly into the console, the result
will be displayed automatically. This does not happen for programs
running as part of a web page. When you want to explicitly show
something in the console, use the <code>console.log</code>
function.</p>

<p>If you want to inspect the environment of a page shown in the
sandbox, you have to take an extra step. If you open a console on that
tab, and you type <code>myMessage</code> into it, it won't find that
variable. This is because the console is connected to the sandbox page
itself, not the page shown inside of it. At the bottom of the console,
there is a control that says <code>&lt;top frame></code>. Click on
this and select the other option to connect the console to the actual
page we wrote.</p>

<p>The button in the example page has a snippet of JavaScript
associated with it through an <code>onclick</code> attribute.
Attributes are <code>name="value"</code> pairs that are specified in
HTML tags. Because the button and the <code>myMessage</code> variable
live on the same page, the <code>onclick</code> program
(<code>alert(myMessage);</code>) can refer to it.
The <code>myvalue</code> variable we defined earlier (on this tab)
is <em>not</em> available on the other tab. Each page is its own
little world, with its own set of variables.</p>

<h2>And now</h2>

<p>You've finished the first part - awesome! Things are about to get a lot more interactive.</p>
