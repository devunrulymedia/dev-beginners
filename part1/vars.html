<h1>Curriculum: part 1, the basics</h1>

<body>

<p>We'll learn to use the browser's JavaScript console, and do some
fundamental programming.</p>

<h2 class=step>Variables</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Understand how to store values and refer to them by name.
Understand what statements are.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Enter the following lines at the console:</p>

<pre>var myvalue = 32 * 32;
alert(myvalue);
myvalue = 10;
alert(myvalue);</pre>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>The above program introduces three new concepts: the semicolons,
the use of <code>var</code>, and the <code>=</code> operator.</p>

<p>The first is the easiest to explain. A program is a series
of <em>statements</em>. An expression with a semicolon after it is a
statement. There are other kinds of statements. The statements in a
program are, as you'd expect, executed from top to bottom.</p>

<p>One special form of statement is a variable declaration. This
introduces a name and associates a value with it. Afterwards, the name
(<code>myvalue</code>, in this case) can be used as an expression that
refers to the current value of the variable by that name.</p>

<p>A variable's value is not constant over the execution of a program
(in this JavaScript variables differ from mathematical variables).
The <code>=</code> operator can be used at any time to give it a new
value, as in the third line of the example.</p>
