<h1>Curriculum: part 1, the basics</h1>

<p>We'll learn to use the browser's JavaScript console, and do some
fundamental programming.</p>


<h2 class=step>Open the console</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Access your browser's JavaScript console.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>In Chrome, press Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows or Linux, press
Command+Option+J on OS X. (Hold down the first two keys, then press J. </p>

<p>You can also go to the wrench menu in the upper right corner of
your window, and select <code>Tools</code> ▸ <code>JavaScript
Console</code>.</p>

<p>The console window should appear at the bottom of your browser window.</p>

<p>Resize it by dragging its top border.</p>

<p>Click through the icons along the top, and enjoy the awesomely
complicated-looking graphs and tech-garble. This
is <strong>your</strong> command center now.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>The console is a powerful, convenient interface to the innards of a
web page. It allows you to step through the atoms from which a page is
built (the 'Elements' tab), to see which files it is composed of, to
diagnose problems, and, most importantly for us, to play with the
JavaScript environment in the current page.</p>

<p>Don't feel obliged to understand any of its functionality right
now. Most of it, we will not need for this course, and the part that
you need will be explained as we go on.</p>
