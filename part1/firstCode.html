<h1>Curriculum: part 1, the basics</h1>

<p>We'll learn to use the browser's JavaScript console, and do some
fundamental programming.</p>

<h2 class=step>Enter your first code</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Actually type in some JavaScript, and see it run.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Go to the 'Console' (rightmost) tab in the browser console.</p>

<p>Type random junk next to the <strong>></strong> sign and press enter.</p>

<p>Now type <code>1 + 1</code> and press enter.</p>

<p>Next, type <code>alert("This computer does what [name] tells it to
do")</code>. Mind the double quotes and parentheses. Substitute your
name for <code>[name]</code>.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>This part is the essence of the JavaScript console: you get to type
in a one-line program, and the browser will run it for you, and tell
you what the result was. If you write something that is not a valid
program, it will try to tell you what went wrong.</p>

<p>The first program, <code>1 + 1</code>, won't look too foreign. You
should read it as a series of commands to the computer: <em>give me
the number one, now give me another one, now add them both
together</em>. I.e. JavaScript programs do not refer to abstract
concepts (addition of one and one), but to a series of very pedestrian
steps that the computer is instructed to take.</p>

<p>The second program (<code>alert(…)</code>) is a function call.
Functions are operations that can be invoked. The function available
under the name <code>alert</code> is an operation for showing a little
dialog window on the screen. The parentheses are the notation for
invoking a function, and the values in between them are given to the
function as further info. In this case, it told the <code>alert</code>
function which text to display.</p>
