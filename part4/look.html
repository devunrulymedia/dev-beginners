<h1>Curriculum: part 4, a game</h1>

<p>When discussing the material we were going to present for this
course, someone suggested that writing a game would be a great
introduction to programming. To my surprise, someone else mentioned
that they did not think writing a game was a very interesting
thing.</p>

<p>I've thought long and hard about what that latter remark might have
meant. I'm still confused.</p>

<p>If you are someone who can conceive of the notion of game
programming being boring, I must apologize to you. In part four, we
will work on a game.</p>


<h2 class=step>Look at it!</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Stop believing that programming an interactive game is in any way
hard to do.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Open <a href="/sandbox/#invaders.js" target=_blank>the game</a>.</p>

<p>Play the game. Think <em>"Yeah, that would have been impressive—if
this were 1970."</em></p>

<p>Read through the code and the comments.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>With some extremely trivial computations, you can produce an
interactive game experience. Or some similarly engaging object, such
as a simulation of something (physics, life). Isn't that cool?</p>
