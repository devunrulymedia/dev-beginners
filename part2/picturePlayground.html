<h1>Curriculum: page 2, pictures</h1>

<p>Part 1 told you exactly, literally what to do, without
leaving you any choices. We apologize for this shameless suppression
of your artistic self. Now that you know the basics, the course
material will be less linear, with more room for experimentation.</p>

<h2 class=step>Open the picture playground</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Get acquainted with our visual programming environment.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Open the <a href="../sandbox/#drawing.js" target=_blank>playground
page</a> in a new tab.</p>

<p>Rejoice.</p>

<p>Next, read the first part of the JavaScript program.</p>

<p>Randomly play around with the content of the <code>drawing</code>
function. Change some numbers and colors, render again. Now read the
text below the program and add some new shapes.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>What we are going to do is get a feel for programming concepts by
applying them to something easily observable: graphics. The linked
page defines a number of convenient drawing operations for us, and
invites you to experiment with them.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the program there are a number of lines starting
with two slashes (<code>//</code>). These are
called <em>comments</em>. They clarify the program, but are not
actually part of it. You can write anything you want in a comment, the
computer won't even look at it.</p>

<p>Your programs, as entered into the sandbox page, don't run in a
vacuum. We have, for the purpose of this course, defined a number of
simple functions for performing graphics operations, as described at
the bottom of the example, and your program may refer to those.</p>

<p>The <code>function drawing()</code> part defines a function
named <code>drawing</code>. We'll see more about function definitions
in a few steps, but this one is special, in that it is executed when
the script is rendered. Thus, it is the place where the statements
that produce your drawing go.</p>
