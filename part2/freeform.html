<h1>Curriculum: page 2, pictures</h1>

<p>Part 1 told you exactly, literally what to do, without
leaving you any choices. We apologize for this shameless suppression
of your artistic self. Now that you know the basics, the course
material will be less linear, with more room for experimentation.</p>

<h2 class=step>Free-form</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Write some kind of entertaining graphical program yourself.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Here are some tools to help you get started:</p>

<p><code>Math.random()</code> can be used to produce a random
(unpredictable) number between zero and one. Thus, <code>Math.random()
* 10</code> produces a number between zero and ten, and so on.</p>

<p><code>setInterval(func, n)</code> is a way to run a function
every <code>n</code> milliseconds. If you combine it with
the <code>clear</code> function to clear the screen, you can produce
an animation. You can find a
demonstration <a href="../sandbox/#drawing_animate.js"
target=_blank>here</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>moveTo</code>, <code>rotate</code>, <code>scale</code>,
and <code>goBack</code> functions defined in the playground, when
combined with functions that call themselves, make it very easy to
define hierarchical, fractal drawing.
See <a href="../sandbox/#drawing_tree.js" target=_blank>this tree</a> for
an example.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>Doing is the best way to learn. Go nuts. Think of something
elaborate. Ask the coaches for help when you are unsure how to go
about something.</p>

<h2>And on</h2>
