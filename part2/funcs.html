<h1>Curriculum: page 2, pictures</h1>

<p>Part 1 told you exactly, literally what to do, without
leaving you any choices. We apologize for this shameless suppression
of your artistic self. Now that you know the basics, the course
material will be less linear, with more room for experimentation.</p>

<h2 class=step>Functions</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Now consider that we want to draw a smiley in multiple, specific
places. We could repeat the six statements needed to draw one such
shape several times, but again, what we're trying to do here is to
make the computer <strong>work</strong> for us.</p>

<p>We are about to learn how to define new functions to perform useful
operations for us.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>This is the <code>smiley</code> function:</p>

<pre>function smiley(x, y) {
  moveTo(x, y);
  color("yellow");
  circle(0, 0, 50);
  color("black");
  circle(-20, 10, 7);
  circle(20, 10, 7);
  lineWidth(3);
  path("g -20 -10 q 20 -10 0 -50 c");
  goBack();
}</pre>

<p>You can put it in your code next to the <code>drawing</code>
function, and change that function to call it,
as <a href="../sandbox/#drawing_function.js" target=_blank>shown
here</a>:</p>

<pre>function drawing() {
  smiley(0, 0);
  smiley(-100, 20);
  smiley(100, 50);
}</pre>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>A function is, in effect, a shorthand for a piece of code. You
define it with the <code>function</code> word as shown above. This
produces a variable with the given name (<code>smiley</code>, in this
case) that refers to the chunk of code. The words after the function's
name—<code>(x, y)</code>—are the <em>parameters</em> to the function.
These are given a value when the function is used. For
example <code>smiley(0, 0)</code> will run the function's body with
both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> holding the value zero.</p>

<p>One thing to be aware of is that variables defined inside functions
(including their parameters), are <em>local</em> to that function. So
if you have another function that also has a parameter
called <code>x</code>, such as <code>circle</code>, that
function's <code>x</code> and the one in <code>smiley</code> are
separate variables, and do not interfere with each other. Mentions
of <code>x</code> in <code>smiley</code> refer to that
function's <code>x</code>, and mentions in other functions refer to
whichever variable happens to be called <code>x</code> in that
function.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> define a
function <code>smileySquadron</code>, which, given <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code> parameters, draws five or so smileys next to each
other by using a <code>while</code> loop. Once it works, use it to
draw a whole lot of smileys.</p>
