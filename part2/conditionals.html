<h1>Curriculum: page 2, pictures</h1>

<p>Part 1 told you exactly, literally what to do, without
leaving you any choices. We apologize for this shameless suppression
of your artistic self. Now that you know the basics, the course
material will be less linear, with more room for experimentation.</p>

<h2 class=step>Conditional execution</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Next, we want to draw every other dot in our lines of dots in a
different color. The even ones should be black, the odd ones grey.</p>

<p>In order to do this, we will learn about conditional statements.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Here is the program that, when put inside the <code>drawing</code>
function, does what we want, and is
available <a href="../sandbox/#drawing_if.js" target=_blank>here</a>:</p>

<pre>var count = 0;
while (count < 20) {
  if (count % 2 == 0) {
    color("black");
  } else {
    color("gray");
  }
  circle(count * 10, 0, 4);
  count = count + 1;
}</pre>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>The first new concept introduced here is the <code>%</code>
operator. This is pronounced 'remainder'. It is not a very important
operator, but it is useful here. What it does is divide the value on
the left by the one on the right, and give us the remainder of that
division. Thus, <code>count % 2 == 0</code> is a way to check
whether <code>count</code> is even—if it is, then the remainder of
dividing it by two will be zero.</p>

<p>But the <em>important</em> new concept introduced here is
the <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement. Like a loop, it
accepts a condition. If the condition is <code>true</code>, it will
execute the statement coming after it. Otherwise, it will execute the
statement that follows the <code>else</code> word.</p>

<p>The <code>else</code> part can be left off to indicate that nothing
at all should happen when the condition does not hold.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> extend the example program to draw every
third dot 10 units higher than the others. Hint: define a
variable <code>height</code> and set its value inside of a
conditional.</p>
