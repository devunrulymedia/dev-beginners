<h1>Curriculum: part 2, pictures</h1>

<p>Part 1 told you exactly, literally what to do, without
leaving you any choices. We apologize for this shameless suppression
of your artistic self. Now that you know the basics, the course
material will be less linear, with more room for experimentation.</p>

<h2 class=step>The loop</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Learn what a loop is, and how to express them in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Problem statement: we want to draw twenty dots, without
writing <code>circle(x, y, something)</code> twenty times.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Open <a href="/sandbox/#drawing_loop.js" target=_blank>this link</a>
to get a <code>drawing</code> function containing this program:</p>

<pre>color("red");
var count = 0;
while (count < 20) {
  circle(count * 10, 0, 4);
  count = count + 1;
}</pre>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>A program, when not otherwise instructed, will simply execute its
statements from top to bottom. The great thing about making a computer
work for us is that it can take repetetive tasks of our hand. Thus, we
don't want to write <code>circle(0, 0, 4); circle(10, 0, 4);</code> etc
to draw our dots.</p>

<p>The word <code>while</code> can be used to create a special kind of
statement that is called a <em>loop</em>. It consists of
a <em>condition</em> (<code>count &lt; 20</code>) and a <em>body</em>
(the part between the braces). A loop does not obey the usual top-down
order of execution. It will continue executing the body as long as the
condition holds true.</p>

<p>The braces around the two statements inside the loop are used to
group them together—they make clear that these statements both belong
to the loop body. You have probably noticed that some space is added
in front of these, to make it clear that they are part of a block.
This is done to help readability of the program, but isn't
strictly required.</p>

<p>The example code uses a variable to track its progress.
The <code>count</code> variable starts at zero, and is moved forward
by one every time the loop body executes. A loop condition is a
normal expression, and the <code>&lt;</code> symbol is a normal
operator that compares two expressions and returns a value that
indicates whether the one to the left is smaller than the one to the
right. Thus, we can expect the loop body to be executed exactly twenty
times—first with <code>count</code> at zero, then at one, and so on
until nineteen. When it reaches twenty, the condition no longer holds,
and the program continues below the loop (which is the end of our
example).</p>

<p>There are a few more things you might need to know about
the <code>&lt;</code> operator. The value it produces is not a number
or a string, but a new type, called <em>boolean</em>. There are only
two values of this type, called <code>true</code>
and <code>false</code>. There are similar operators for checking
whether a value is greater than (<code>></code>) or equal to
(<code>==</code>) to some other value.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> try to write a program that prints a
20-by-20 <em>grid</em> of dots, instead of just a line. You'll need
two loops, and two counter variables. Hint: you may put a loop inside
another loop.</p>

<p>When trying out programs in the sandbox, keep an eye on the
console. When the computer can't make sense of your program, it will
output (more or less informative) messages there. When nothing happens
after pressing 'Render', chances are you mistyped something.</p>
