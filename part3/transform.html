<h1>Curriculum: page 3, data</h1>

<p>Inside the computer's world, there is only data. That which is not
data, does not exist. Programs are data. Programs create new data.
It's like some kind of strange, silicon-based cycle of life.</p>


<h2 class=step>Transforming data</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Independently write a program that summarizes a dataset.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>In <a href="../sandbox/#transform.js" target=_blank>the program for
this step</a>, there is a function <code>visualizeHistory</code>,
which is a lot like the <code>showCountry</code> function we used
before, except that it can be used to plot any data. It takes an array
of values and a vertical scale (the amount of vertical space one unit
of the input data takes up) as parameters.</p>

<p>Finish the <code>showWorldPopulation</code> function. It should
somehow compute the world population for each of the years in the
dataset, put those numbers into an array, and correctly call
the <code>visualizeHistory</code> function on that array.</p>

<p>To build up an array, follow this pattern:</p>

<pre>var newArray = []; // empty
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
  newArray.push(i);
}</pre>

<p>The <code>push</code> function, which is a property
(<em>method</em>) of every array value, is used to add an element the
array.</p>

<p>To figure out the correct vertical scale for your graph, keep track
of the maximum world population in the whole dataset (either
using <code>if</code> with the <code>></code> operator, or
the <code>Math.max</code> function, which can be given two arguments
and returns the greatest of the two).</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>The data is not in entirely the most obvious format for the purpose
of summing up population per-year—we'd prefer to be able to
straightforwardly get a collection of all populations for a given
year.</p>

<p>But still, by using a loop inside of a loop, with the outer loop
going over the years (use, for
example, <code>countryData[0].population.length</code> to know the
total amount of years to loop over) and the inner loop going over the
countries. It can then pick out the population for the current year
from each country, and add it to the sum (which should be reset to
zero at the start of every repetition of the outer loop).</p>

<p>Give it a shot. If you get stuck, flag down a coach.</p>

<p>Some other ideas for teasing interesting visualizations out of this
data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each country also has a <code>region</code> property. These are
  three-letter abbreviations that divide the world into seven areas.
  (You can get their full name by using the <code>regionName</code>
  function that is supplied along with the data.) Try to display a
  diagram that shows the percentages of the world population living in
  each of these regions, in each year (for example by showing a
  vertical stack of colored bars for each year).</li>
  <li>The country objects also contain a <code>fertility</code>
  property that, for each year, gives the country's fertility rate.
  Plot a two-dimensional picture for a certain year, which shows the
  correlation between life expectancy and fertility rate (i.e. life
  expectancy on the x axis, fertility on the y axis).</li>
  <li>Animate some per-year visualization, for example the one
  described in the point above this, over time. Use
  the <code>setTimeout</code> trick demonstrated
  in <a href="../sandbox/#drawing_animate.js" target=_blank>this example
  from the part 3</a>, cycling through the years and drawing a
  new picture (including a call to <code>text</code> to display the
  year) every tenth of a second or so.</li>
</ul>
