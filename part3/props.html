<h1>Curriculum: page 3, data</h1>

<p>Inside the computer's world, there is only data. That which is not
data, does not exist. Programs are data. Programs create new data.
It's like some kind of strange, silicon-based cycle of life.</p>

<h2 class=step>Named properties</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Learn how to create objects, and access their properties.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Open the console again, in case you had closed it.</p>

<p>Create a variable by entering this in the console: <code>var myObject = {name: "Larry", score: 100};</code></p>

<p>Evaluate <code>myObject.name</code> and <code>myObject.score</code>.</p>

<p>Also evaluate <code>myObject["name"]</code> and <code>myObject["sco" + "re"]</code>.</p>

<p>Give the object another property with <code>myObject.color =
"purple"</code>. Then evaluate <code>myObject.color</code>.</p>

<p>Change the <code>score</code> property by doing 
<code>myObject.score = 105</code>. Evaluate <code>myObject.score</code>
again to convince yourself that it worked.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>Objects are also collections of values. But they require every
value to have a name. Arrays are useful when collecting any number of
values in a homogenous group, whereas objects are more appropriate
when each value has a specific, distinct role. I.e. a big bag of
potatoes is an array, but the parts that make up a car (engine, wheels,
each with their own role) form an object.</p>

<p>The <code>{property1: value1, property2: value2}</code> syntax is
used to create a new object. There are two ways to access the
properties of an object. The <code>object.property</code> way is used
when you know the name of the property in advance.
The <code>object["property"]</code> way allows the property name to be
any expression, and thus is useful when the name needs to be computed
somehow.</p>

<p>Together, objects and arrays provide a way to express a wide
variety of information. For example, a list of players in a game would
typically be an array of objects, where each object represents a
player. If a list of achievements has to be associated with players,
that would be another array inside of each object, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Figure out a JavaScript representation
for a chess game board. There are multiple good solutions.</p>
